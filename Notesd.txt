- Configuration file is stored in the server and the data will bet fetched from the server;

	* Check in a local computer if the user has configured his database or not.
	* If the user has not configured the database yet i display the configuration form to fill in the fields.
	* After that the appication can connect to the database directly.

- HOW??

	* Check whether the file exists on local computer if not then create it.NOO!!
	* Check if the file has any values or not.
	* The application checks for the file before connecting to the database.
	* The app uses the configuration in the file for initial connection.
	* After the app connect and the database is configured i no longer need the file.
	* I need something to tell me if i should display the initial configuration form for ther user or not.
	* Proper solution is to do everything in the Program class.
	



	/* ---------------- MORE NOTES 03/02/2017 -----------------------*/

	* File must exists 
	* Checking if the file has any values or not 
		* If the file is empty then we should display the Configuration form to allow the user to configure the database
		* If the file is full then i need to read the data out of it 
		* Pass the data that i got out of the file to the database constructor.
		* More exception handling is required in this case.
